      <h1>The Last Entry</h1>

      <p>
        The rain lashed against the window of the old observatory, drowning out
        the hum of the cooling fans. Dr. Aris Thorne had spent twenty years
        searching for the signal. He wasn't looking for aliens or lost
        satellites; he was looking for the "Ghost Key," a piece of encryption so
        old that modern computers simply ignored it as background noise.
      </p>

      <p>
        He adjusted the frequency on his monitor. The static cleared. It wasn't
        a sound wave—it was text. Aris leaned in, his glasses reflecting the
        blue light of the terminal. The chaos of the data stream suddenly
        organized itself into a single, coherent line. It was a message left by
        the system's original creator, a failsafe intended to be found only when
        the network was on the brink of collapse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aris held his breath. He didn't need to decrypt it. It was written in
        plain text, glowing right in the center of his screen, marking the
        location of the backup server:
      </p>

      <div class="artifact-box">hidden_flag{i_hate_agent}</div>

      <p>
        He stared at the string of characters. It was almost too simple. For
        decades, cryptographers had been looking for complex algorithms,
        mathematical impossibilities, and quantum keys. But the answer was just
        a string of text, hiding in the open, waiting for someone to stop
        calculating and start reading.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aris picked up the phone. "I found it," he whispered into the receiver.
        "And it was staring at us the whole time."
